# EvlDaemon ![Build](https://github.com/Tokenize/evl-daemon-elixir/actions/workflows/elixir/badge.svg)

**An Elixir API & daemon for the Envisa TPI (DSC) module**

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add `evl_daemon` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

    ```elixir
    def deps do
      [{:evl_daemon, "~> 0.4.0"}]
    end
    ```

  2. Ensure `evl_daemon` is started before your application:

    ```elixir
    def application do
      [applications: [:evl_daemon]]
    end
    ```

## Usage

  1. Copy the `config/evl_daemon.json.sample` file to either `/etc/evl_daemon.json` or `$HOME/.config/evl_daemon/config.json` and set your API keys, IP address and password.

  2. Build a release by running one of the two commands:
      - `mix release` to build a release in development mode (no emails will be sent in this mode).
      - `MIX_ENV=prod mix release --env prod` to build a release in production mode.

  3. Run evl_daemon in one of the following ways (replace env with either *prod* / *dev*):
      - Foreground: `_build/env/rel/evl_daemon/bin/evl_daemon start_iex`
      - Daemon: `_build/env/rel/evl_daemon/bin/evl_daemon daemon`
      - Remote console: `_build/env/rel/evl_daemon/bin/evl_daemon remote`

## HTTP JSON API

The following actions are supported via a simple API which is protected behind an authentication token.
  - Seeing the system status by visiting **/system_status**
  - Seeing a list of the latest 100 events by visiting **/events**
  - Silent-Arming the system by doing a POST request to **/tasks**
  - Deleting an existing task by doing a DELETE request to **/tasks**

  All the actions requires setting the *auth_token* parameter and it must match the value in the config file.

  ### Tasks
  Currently, the only supported task type is *silent_arm* and you can enable it by doing the following:
 Â 
  ```
  curl --verbose -X POST -H Content-Type:application/json -d "{\"type\":\"silent_arm\", \"zones\":\"[1,5]\"}" http://127.0.0.1:4000/tasks\?auth_token\=SECRET
  ```

  If the request is successful then you should get a response with HTTP status 201, otherwise you'll get a response with HTTP status 422 and a description of the error.

  To delete this task, you can do the following:

  ```
  curl --verbose -X DELETE -H Content-Type:application/json -d "{\"type\":\"silent_arm\", \"zones\":[\"001\",\"005\"]}" http://127.0.0.1:4000/tasks\?auth_token\=SECRET
  ```

  The Silent Arm task will automatically terminate when it detects a *System Arming In Progress* or *Partition Armed* event.
